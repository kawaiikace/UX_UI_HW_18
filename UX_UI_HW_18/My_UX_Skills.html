      <h3 class="skills">User Research</h3>
      <p class="skillsParagraph"> I employ various research methods, such as user interviews, surveys, and usability testing, to gather insights directly from users. By understanding their needs, preferences, and pain points, I can create designs that are highly functional and user-centric. Ultimately, my commitment to user research enables me to craft experiences that delight users and effectively meet their goals.</p>

      <h3 class="skills">Visual Design</h3>
      <p class="skillsParagraph">I leverage visual design principles to create engaging and effective user interfaces. I focus on elements such as color theory, typography, and layout to enhance the overall aesthetic and usability of my designs. By applying a cohesive visual hierarchy, I guide users through the interface, ensuring that important information stands out and is easily accessible. This attention to visual design helps me to elevate user engagement and satisfaction across my projects.</p>

    <div class="skills three"><img src="images/my_ux_skills_images/collaboration_icon.png" alt="collab icon" class="icon">
      <h3 class="skills">Collaboration</h3>
      <p class="skillsParagraph">Collaboration is at the heart of my design process, and I actively engage with cross-functional teams to drive project success. I facilitate brainstorming sessions and design critiques to ensure that everyone’s input is valued, ultimately leading to a more refined and effective final product. Through collaboration, I not only enhance the quality of my work but also build strong relationships that contribute to a positive team dynamic.</p>
